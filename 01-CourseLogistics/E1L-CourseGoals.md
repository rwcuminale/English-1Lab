# Course Goals
## English 1 Lab

Most importantly, above all else, my aim is for students to leave this course with five things:

* Discovering the joys of reading and writing for yourself;
* A sense of confidence when you must read or write because you have to;
* Knowledge of how to make the writing process work for you;
* Earning a killer grade in English 1;
* The accomplishment of reading 1,000 pages this year.

A more precise and detailed list follows:
